# Getting Started

</a>

The package purplecheeri-wave is used to create webservices with configuration files and business logic specific to your needs. 

The configurations files allow you to specify service instance, the paramters and their validation along with the security options.

To run a sample webservice, you would need 

- a service configuration file ( example: [appserviceconfig.json](#applicationserviceconfig) )
- an app configuration file ( example: [appconfig.json](#applicationconfig) )
- a custom business logic for each route you expose ( example: [sampleservice.js](#sampleserviceimplementation) )
- your primary file ( example: [index.js](#startsampleservice) )

- in addition to this purplecheerio-wave comes with some default certificates if you want to specify a secure way to publish your webservice.  These certifcates should be replaced by your organizations certificates if you want to deploy these webservices for external use.

- The package allows your services to be tested at:  

```sh 

http[s]://localhost:[port]/test


```
The testing framework can be customized to your enterprise needs (logo, look and feel with configuration changes)

- The package allows your services to be documented for use  at:  

```sh 

http[s]://localhost:[port]/Documentation

```

#### Create appserviceconfig.json which contains the sampleservice configuration information
</a>

```sh
{
  "services": 
  {
    "sampleservice": {
      "protocol": "http",
      "port": 8888,
      "hostname": "localhost",
      "description": "REST END POINT For Sample Service.",
      "configfilepath": "./appconfig.json",
      "security": "nokey"
    }
  }
}
```

<a id="applicationconfig">

#### Create appconfig.json to declare the routes.
</a>
Each route configuration section has a name, route url path, description, examples, param and body schema sections etc. Most importantly it contains the type which tells what method is supported. Method values supported are 'get', 'post', 'put', 'delete', and 'static'. All methods except 'static' conform to the standard http methods and follow REST API guidelines.

The 'static' method in particular is used to server static files like css, html, client-side javascript files, images etc. The 'routeclass' in this case describes the path to the location of static files. The 'routefunction' 'paramschema', 'bodyschema', 'responseschema' are ignored for this type.

Below is a sample configuration file with a route with 'get', 'post', and 'static' methods. This configuration file could include paramschema, bodyschema and responseschema

```sh
{
    "servicename": "sampleservice",
    "routes": [
        {

<a id="sampleserviceimplementation">

#### Create a file sampleservice.js that implements this route.
</a>

```sh

exports.RouteGetSomething = function(req,res)
{
    res.status(200).json({"value":"hello world"});
}
exports.RoutePostSomething = function(req,res)
{
    res.status(200).json({"params=":req.params,"body":req.body});
}

```

<a id="startsampleservice">

#### Create a file index.js to initialized and start purplecheerio-wave
</a>

```sh


var app = require('purplecheerio-wave');
app.startservice("sampleservice", __dirname, "./appserviceconfig.json");

```
<a id="runsampleservice">

#### Now execute the service
</a>

```sh
node index.js
```

You can then access this sampleservice in your browser

```sh
http://localhost:8888/sampleservice/something/foo/100 

will return

{"value":"hello world"}

```

In addition a POST route will be enabled 

```sh
http://localhost:8888/sampleservice/something/foo/100 that takes a post with body json like this:
{
  "value3":{"value5":"bar"},
  "value4":"blah"
}
```
<a id="systemservices">

System services
----
</a>

Key Manager(keymgr) is one of the services that's shipped by default with the wave platform.
Key Manager service provides routes for generating access and secret keys, provision access to various services which have security set as "acckey"

To see the full documentation on system services, please run the keymgr service.

To run the system services, copy the code below into a file called systemservicesindex.js

 
```sh
const app = require('purplecheerio-wave');
const initoptions={
 "aclconfig":"aclconfig.json",
 "secret":"helloworld",
 "appserviceconfig":"appserviceconfig.json",
 "appdir":__dirname
}

app.startsystemservice("keymgr",initoptions);
```

after this run the systemservice by invoking

```sh

node systemservicesindex.js

```
Note that the keys are stored encrypted in the file pointed to by aclconfigpath (in this case it's ./aclconfig.json).

Microservice Documentation
----
</a>
Detailed documentation for each app services started on localhost is available at the localhost:<port#> port# can be any of the app services started.

https://localhost:8888/documentation has documentation available for all app services.
https://localhost:8888/services will listout each service
https://localhost:8888/service/sampleservice will list each route for the sample service with detailed documentation

You can also use https://localhost:8888/test to get a form where you can test your sample service. 

Documentation for the system services like keymgr are available at any port of a running system service. "keymgr" service uses port 4003 and https://localhost:4003/documentation has the documentation for the system services.



<a id="schematizedmicroservices">

Schematized Micro-Services
----
</a>
json-schema is an IETF standard for defining json payloads. PurpleCheerio-wire uses json schema in defining various objects. All usage of schema is optional and is used to validate the routes, responses etc. Use of json-schema is encouraged as it makes the code more robust and also serves as documentation.

#### The following are some of the places where json-schema is expected to be provided by the developer of micro-services:

 - Request parameter schmea
 - Request body schema
 - Response schema
 - initilization option schema

#### Example of json-schema
Example use of Request schmeas are in the sampleservice in examples directory.
keymgr system service uses init options schema
Full json-schema sepcification can be found at https://json-schema.org/
Examples can be found at https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html
